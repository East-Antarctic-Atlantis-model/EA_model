# East Antarctic Atlantis Ecosystem Model

![Map of Antarctica and study area](figures/ea_atlantis_map.png)

## Description

The East Antarctic Atlantis Ecosystem Model is a comprehensive simulation model that represents the ecosystem dynamics of the East Antarctic region. This model incorporates various environmental factors, biological interactions, and human uses to simulate the functioning and sustainability of the East Antarctic ecosystem.

The model consists of 29 boxes (i.e., 29 polygons with max. 10 depth layers + sediment layer) and 29 functional groups. The physical conditions are driven by ACCESS-OM2-CICE outputs (usage validated by Fierro-Arcos et al. 2023: https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079661123000927) 

## Features

- Simulates the interactions between key components of the East Antarctic ecosystem, including marine life, land-based organisms, and climate factors.
- Provides insights into the population dynamics, food web relationships, and species distributions within the East Antarctic ecosystem.
- Enables the exploration of different scenarios and the assessment of potential impacts on the ecosystem due to climate change, fishing activities, or other human interventions.
