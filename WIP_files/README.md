## Introduction to folder structures and files

Note: WIP_files folder contains most up-to-date model files as modified by IS during calibration. Files will be added as calibration progresses and better results are achieved.

Welcome to EAntarctic, the Atlantis model for the East Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. 
This version is up to date as of September 2023 and includes files for running the model through Docker.

Recent changes pertain to phytoplankton growth rate and nutrient requirements.
